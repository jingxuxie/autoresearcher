The automatic loop should continue only under a reframed stochastic TRL question:

> Can transition-level stochastic uncertainty plus log-space transitive propagation produce calibrated long-horizon goal reachability under finite offline stochastic coverage?

Current evidence to preserve:

- Raw deterministic-style TRL has a real stochastic overoptimism failure mode.
- Log-TRL is a useful long-horizon propagation baseline.
- The current successor-distance plus TRL-log formulation is negative or not distinct from TRL-log.
- The hand-shaped one-sided penalty is diagnostic, not a general method.
- The generic count/Dirichlet-style uncertainty penalty reduced some Q overestimation but did not fix policy-level lucky-only regret.

Future positive criteria:

1. Preserve deterministic chain held-out MSE near zero.
2. Preserve matched safe-optimal and matched risk-optimal action choices.
3. Improve safe-optimal lucky-only policy regret versus TRL-log.
4. Avoid simply choosing safe everywhere.
5. Beat or match a simple empirical-transition-model DP baseline.
6. Show a specific benefit from transitive/log-TRL beyond transition uncertainty alone.

Recommended next experiment:

Run an identifiability and coverage grid before adding more algorithms. Sweep true risky success probability, safe path length, risky sample count, and observed risky successes. Compare empirical risky value, posterior means/quantiles, lower/upper confidence choices, TRL-log, and raw TRL. Save the grid, regret heatmaps, impossibility cases, result JSON, and summary under iteration `0008`.

The expected value of this experiment is not an algorithm win. It should identify which regimes are solvable from offline data and which require explicit priors or assumptions.
